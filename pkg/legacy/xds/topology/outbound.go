// endpointWeight defines default weight for in-cluster endpoint.
// Examples of having service "backend":
//  1. Single-zone deployment, 2 instances in one cluster (zone1)
//     All endpoints have to have the same weight (ex. 1) to achieve fair loadbalancing.
//     Endpoints:
//     * backend-zone1-1 - weight: 1
//     * backend-zone1-2 - weight: 1
//  2. Multi-zone deployment, 2 instances in "zone1" (local zone), 3 instances in "zone2" (remote zone) with 1 Ingress instance
//     Endpoints:
//     * backend-zone1-1 - weight: 1
//     * backend-zone1-2 - weight: 1
//     * ingress-zone2-1 - weight: 3 (all remote endpoints are aggregated to one Ingress, it needs to have weight of instances in other cluster)
//  3. Multi-zone deployment, 2 instances in "zone1" (local zone), 2 instances in "zone2" (remote zone) with 1 Ingress instance
//     Many instances of Ingress will forward the traffic to the same endpoints in "zone2" so we need to lower the weights.
//     Since weights are integers, we cannot put fractional on ingress endpoints weights, we need to adjust "default" weight for local zone
//     Endpoints:
//     * backend-zone1-1 - weight: 2
//     * backend-zone1-2 - weight: 2
//     * ingress-zone2-1 - weight: 3
